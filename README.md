# my-html-portfolio

## Description

For this challenge, I was asked to build a portfolio page of my own. My portfolio showcases information about me, the projects I've worked on, and my contact information. My motivation was to create a clear, straigthtforward site with the tools I've learned in CSS so far. I built this project to practice the skills I've learned up until now, such as the flexbox, creating functional links, the hover effect, and the shadow effect. My project answers the request in the user story, which is to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples that way they can assess me as a candidate. I learned a lot about web design and CSS in this challenge. I learned that the little effects and choice of font/color scheme are what make the site up to today's standard web design. I also learned that margins play a large role in flexbox and web design. I had to play with the margins a lot to achieve the web layout I created.

## Installation

My first step of installation was creating an html from scratch, a css style page, and linking the css to my html. I created a title for my portfolio "Dimitra Anastasopoulos" which is found in the first h1.

Next, in my body tag, I created my nav. This is where you find the buttons "About Me," "Work," "Contact," and "Resume." I edited my nav bar in css, by using display: flex, and justify-content: flex-end to make the nav bar appear to the far right of the screen. I also edited the font and color.

Next, I worked on the header of my page. I inserted a header image in the class "hero" in css, where i created a flexbox for my header and inserted a background image url. I also included the background-size: cover to make sure the image covered the entire flexbox, instead of repeating itself. I created a title "My Portfolio" and inserted it to apper on top of my image in css under "h2." I edited the font color, background color, and font to make it more appealing.
