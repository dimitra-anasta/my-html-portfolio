# my-html-portfolio

## Description

For this challenge, I was asked to build a portfolio page of my own. My portfolio showcases information about me, the projects I've worked on, and my contact information. My motivation was to create a clear, straigthtforward site with the tools I've learned in CSS so far. I built this project to practice the skills I've learned up until now, such as the flexbox, creating functional links, the hover effect, and the shadow effect. My project answers the request in the user story, which is to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples that way they can assess me as a candidate. I learned a lot about web design and CSS in this challenge. I learned that the little effects and choice of font/color scheme are what make the site up to today's standard web design. I also learned that margins play a large role in flexbox and web design. I had to play with the margins a lot to achieve the web layout I created.
